This package is strictly derivative of the apache thrift package. The code is not modified, this repository just represents a packaged subset of their code since the module is so large

This package does not contain the compiler, just the code for loading generated javascript from the thrift 0.9.3 compiler

Currently derived from thrift 0.9.3
